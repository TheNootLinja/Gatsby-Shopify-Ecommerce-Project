# Gatsby Ecommerce Project

This is my project I built using Gatsby and the Shopify API to build an ecommerce site themed around selling noodles (hence the name Send Noods!).

## TODO List

[] Make the site title a link to the home page
[] Create about page
[] Style Home page
[] Style shop page
[] Style cart page
[] Style header component
[] Style individual product pages
